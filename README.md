# snell_tool

**snell_tool** requires Python 3 and a few standard python packages. If you do not already have Python installed, I recommend the Anaconda python distribution, https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/.

Once *python* and *pip* -- the Package Installer for Python (this comes automatically with Anaconda) -- are installed, you can install **snell_tool** by executing the following command at a terminal from within the main `snell_tool` directory:

`pip install .`

Once installed, see `snell_example.ipynb` for usage. To open `snell_example.ipynb`, first run `jupyter notebook` from a terminal, and navigate to the file in jupyter's web browser application.
